# Radius
Prompts the user for the number value of radius and outputs the area of the circle using C++.

Instructions: Create C++ code statements that will ask for the value of radius then compute for the Area of a circle. 
Given the formula: Area of Circle = PI * radius * radius, where PI = 3.14159265.
